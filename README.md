# 📘 Sentiment Analysis – Baseline Machine Learning Model

This repository contains a **simple and clean sentiment analysis pipeline** built using Python and NLP techniques.  
It demonstrates how to convert raw text into sentiment predictions using a baseline ML model.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a **beginner-friendly** sentiment classifier using:

- Text preprocessing  
- TF-IDF feature extraction  
- A baseline machine learning model (Logistic Regression / SVM)  
- Model saving & loading  
- A prediction pipeline  

Everything is implemented step-by-step inside the notebook.

## 🧩 Real Challenges Faced

These are the **actual** challenges encountered in this project:

- Maintaining consistent preprocessing during both training and prediction  
- Ensuring TF-IDF vocabulary persists correctly after saving/loading  
- Handling file path issues in Google Colab when saving `.pkl` files  
- Avoiding unnecessary complexity while building a clean baseline model  
- Ensuring predictions remain stable on unseen input  
- Designing a reusable, user-friendly prediction pipeline  
- Making the notebook workflow easy to follow for beginners
